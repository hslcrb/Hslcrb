## 🏗️ System Architecture Philosophy

Our systems are built on three core pillars:
1. **Performance First**: Zero-cost abstractions and efficient resource management.
2. **Visual Narrative**: Every interface tells a story through Frutiger Aero and Glassmorphism.
3. **Local-First**: Prioritizing user privacy and offline capabilities.
